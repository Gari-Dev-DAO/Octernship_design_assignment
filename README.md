With a combined community of 130M+ and growing, $GARI was introduced as a social token for the Chingari creators to create engaging content and for users to engage with the content. These tokens are not only tradeable for their local currency but also provide governance authority over Chingar’s future developments.

To incentivize creators and users that are more active than others, GARI is creating a program that allows users to mint badges based on their activity on the platform. These badges in-turn lead to rewards in the form of GARI tokens.
